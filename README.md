Welcome to Nerve Gear Developer Network!

You can **reuse** or **publish** plug-ins, components, objects, interfaces and some other amazing resources here.

Please read [Collaborative Development](https://github.com/NERvGear/NERvSDK/wiki/5.Collaborative-Development) page before you can start with this powerful collaborative development framework.

#### Let's Quests!

If you want to request other developers for the implementations of interfaces or components, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/NERvGear/NERvHub/issues) with title:

> [QUEST] _YOUR_REQUEST_HERE_

Then developers will see your request in the issue list and if someone could meet the needs, he should assign himself to the  `Assignee` to tell others that he has accepted this quest.

If a request is no longer needed, or has been accomlished by someone, the author can close this quest.
